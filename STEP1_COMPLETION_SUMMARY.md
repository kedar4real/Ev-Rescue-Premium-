## üöÄ Next Steps (Step 2)

With Step 1 completed, the next phase should focus on:

1. **Firebase Integration & Authentication**
   - Set up Firebase project
   - Configure environment variables
   - Test authentication flow
   - Implement user profile management

2. **Real-time Features Implementation**
   - Connect to Firebase Firestore
   - Implement real-time updates
   - Add WebSocket-like functionality for live tracking

3. **Payment System Setup**
   - Configure Razorpay integration
   - Implement subscription plans
   - Add payment flow for emergency services

## üì± Current Status

- **Emergency Assistance**: ‚úÖ Fully functional with GPS
- **Charging Finder**: ‚úÖ Fully functional with map integration
- **Live Tracking**: ‚úÖ Already implemented
- **Chat System**: ‚úÖ Already implemented
- **Authentication**: ‚úÖ Integrated but needs Firebase setup
- **Database**: üîÑ Ready for Firebase integration
- **Payment**: üîÑ Ready for Razorpay integration

## üéØ Key Features Working

1. **GPS Location Detection** - Real-time user location
2. **Emergency Request Forms** - Complete form with validation
3. **Charging Station Discovery** - Search, filter, and map view
4. **Interactive Maps** - Leaflet-based station visualization
5. **Real-time Tracking** - Request status monitoring
6. **Live Chat** - Multi-room communication system
7. **User Authentication** - Login/logout flow (needs Firebase setup)

## üîç Testing Recommendations

1. Test GPS location detection on mobile devices
2. Verify emergency form submission flow
3. Test charging station search and filtering
4. Verify map functionality and station markers
5. Test authentication flow (after Firebase setup)
6. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes

## üìã Environment Setup Required

Before testing, you need to:
1. Create `.env.local` file with Firebase credentials
2. Set up Firebase project with Authentication, Firestore, and Storage
3. Configure Razorpay account (for payment testing)
4. Install Leaflet CSS for map styling

The project is now ready for the next phase of development with a solid foundation of core functionality implemented!
